# PicoScope Support Toolbox

The PicoScope Support Toolbox provides a set of classes and functions for use with Pico Technology Instrument Drivers or calling the shared library Application Protocol Interface (API) functions directly from MATLAB when communicating with PicoScope PC Oscilloscopes. 
This toolbox contains Help documentation that can be accessed via the Documentation page in the MATLAB Help menu.
